# Dalynx-Chat-v5

Most recent version of the Dalynx Chat (last worked on in 2016)

I made this so my friends and I who played games together could chat and have a good time, with fun games and activities built in

I stopped working on this project in 2016 so this is the most up to date version of this application

This was made back before I separated and organized code into multiple files so all server-side code is jumbled together into app.js

User profile pictures and background images are saved in ./public/user_images/

achievements.txt lists all the achievements I wanted to add before I stopped working on this project

package.json lists the dependencies needed for this app to run (if it still does)
Dependencies can be installed by navigating to the root folder of the application and running 'npm install'

This is the first ever project I made using NodeJS (started in 2014, the older versions will have their own repositories on my GitHub)
